## yace - yet another code editor

yace (`yaa - cee`) is a proof-of-concept code editor written in Tauri and Typescript powered by Codemirror.
The goal is to see the possibilities of Tauri as a viable framework for writing perfomant JS-oriented apps.

This project's goal **is not** to replace VSCode or similar based-on-JS popular IDEs, but rather to explore the possibilites and bounds of performant JS desktop apps.
